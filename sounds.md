# Gol-Kaa Sounds

## Vowels
Grapheme | IPA
---|---
`a` | /a ~ ɑ/
`e` | /e/
`i` | /i/
`o` | /o ~ ɒ/
`u` | /u/

Duplicating a vowel could lengthen it, providing stress to that syllable:

Grapheme | Word Count | Name Count | IPA
---|---|---|---
`aa` | 2 | 1 | /aː ~ ɑː ~ æ/
`uu` | 0 | 2 | /uː/
`oo` | 0 | 0 | /oː/

Races of Stone's "Gol-Kaa Syllables" table lists `a'a` and `o'o`, which could be pronounced with a /ʔ/ separating the sounds. Due to the limited amount of vowel sounds and no explicit diphthongs, `'` could be used in other vowel clusters to maintain a rhythm in speaking, similar to Hawaiian's [okina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOkina). Clusters with a terminal `a` are easier to pronounce as diphthongs, and may not need the separation.

Original | Word Count | Name Count | Modernization | Notes
---|---|---|---|---
`au` | 8 | 3 | `a'u`  | Might not need `'`
`ae` | 6 | 1 | `a'e`  | Hard to pronounce without `'`
`ua` | 3 | 0 | `ua`   | 
`ea` | 2 | 2 | `e'a`  |
`ia` | 2 | 0 | `ia`   | 
`aua`| 2 | 0 | `a'ua` | Hard to pronounce even with `'`
`ai` | 1 | 2 | `a'i`  | Needs `'`
`eo` | 0 | 2 | `e'o`  |
`uo` | 0 | 1 | `u'o`  |
`ei` | 0 | 1 | `e'i`  |
`uu` | 0 | 2 | `u'u`  | 
`oa` | 0 | 0 | `oa`   |

## Consonants
Grapheme | IPA
---|---
`g` | /g/
`k` | /k/
`l` | /l/
`m` | /m/
`n` | /n/
`p` | /p/
`th` | /t ~ d ~ θ ~ ð/
`v` | /v/
`'` | /ʔ ~ h/, /h/ when immediately after a previous occurance

`gl` is the only consonant cluster and only seen among names, which often use imported sounds among gol-ka'a sounds (`ll`, `nn`, `r`, `y`), so it may not be native to Gol-Kaa. Doubling of consonants could also [shorten the previous vowel](https://english.stackexchange.com/q/4365/54288).
