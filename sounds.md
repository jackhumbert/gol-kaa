# Gol-Ka'a Sounds

`a` | /a/
`e` | /e/
`i` | /i/
`o` | /o/ or /ɒ/
`u` | /u/

There are no diphthongs, so any vowel cluster should be separated into distinct sounds, and preferably transliterated with a `'` separating them, e.g. `gol-ka'a`. A `-` may have been used in the past, but this is now rarely seen, but may be be used to separate consonants, namely in a [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)).

Original vowel clusters can be modernized using this chart:

Original | Word Count | Name Count | Modernization
---|---|---|---
`au` | 8 | 3 | `o`
`ae` | 6 | 1 | `e`
`ua` | 3 | 0 | `u'a`
`ea` | 2 | 2 | `e'a`
`ia` | 2 | 0 | `i'a`
`aua`| 2 | 0 | `o'a`
`ai` | 1 | 2 | `a`
`aa` | 1 | 1 | `a'a`
`eo` | 0 | 2 | `e'o`
`uo` | 0 | 1 | `u`
`ei` | 0 | 1 | `e`
`oo` | 0 | 0 | `u`
`oa` | 0 | 0 | `o'a`

## Consonants
Letter | IPA
---|---
`g` | /g/
`k` | /k/
`l` | /l/
`m` | /m/
`n` | /n/
`p` | /p/
`th` | /t ~ d/
`v` | /v/
`'` | /ʔ ~ h/, /h/ when immediately after a previous occurance

`gl` is the only consonant cluster, and only seen among names, which often use imported sounds among gol-ka'a sounds (`ll`, `nn`, `r`, `y`).
